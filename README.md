This demo uses Tauri, Svelte, and TailwindCSS.

A button allows the user to select one or more png/jpeg files.

Tauri provides the `convertFileSrc` API to convert the file path to an asset path usable by the frontend.

We then display the list of assets, each with a button to delete the asset, and the image previews.
